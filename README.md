## **Key Challenges**
- Advanced **response time optimization** to ensure efficiency.
- Research and development to enhance **contextual understanding** for domain-specific content.
- Balancing simplicity with in-depth explanation to cater to a diverse audience.

---

## **Research Goals**
1. Study existing LLM capabilities (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude).
2. Explore techniques to:
   - Improve latency and model performance.
   - Enhance multi-modal understanding for various types of research papers.
3. Test advanced pre-processing techniques to refine the quality of LLM outputs.
